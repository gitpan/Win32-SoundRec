GENERAL

Win32::SoundRec is a Perl module that allows you to record sound 
on Win32 platforms.

PREREQUISITES

An MCI compatible soundcard to be able to record anything.
You also need the module Win32::API::Prototype, which many people can't 
find. Therefore this link: http://search.cpan.org/~daveroth/Win32-API-Prototype/
This is where you can install the module from.
You can also install the PPM version of this module like this:

ppm install http://www.roth.net/perl/packages/win32-api-prototype.ppd

INSTALL

To install this module you do the following:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

That should do the trick...
Makefile.PL checks if we're on a Microsoft platform. If this check doesn't succeed, no
Makefile will be written. If you think this is an error, please notify me, and remove 
these checks by hand from Makefile.PL yourself and continue with the installation
