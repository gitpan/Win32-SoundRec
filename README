An MCI compatible soundcard

INSTALL

To install this module you do the following:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

That should do the trick...
Makefile.PL checks if we're on a Microsoft platform. If this check doesn't succeed, no
Makefile will be written. If you think this is an error, please notify me, and remove 
these checks by hand from Makefile.PL yourself and continue with the installation
